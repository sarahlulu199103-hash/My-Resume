<h2>Salsa</h2>
<p>
  I love to dance and although I don't have much rythm I have danced salsa for
  many years as I enjoy the social part and getting out and about in winter
</p>

<h2>Knitting</h2>
<p>
  A very recent hobby that I have taken up in the evenings to busy my hands
  while I relax
</p>

<h2>Sewing</h2>
<p>
  another recent hobby, there was a sewing machine gathering dust in teh house
  and I decided to give it a go I have made some frog stuffies with variable
  success but I am now confident I can alter clothes after many trials and
  errors.
